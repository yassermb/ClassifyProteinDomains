The database hosted by Kaggle can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/googleai/pfam-seed-random-split).

The jupyter notebook can be found in the Github repository.

The Google Colab repository is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G5xIYbCP-EaPs9u5mbOLPI04jsJCx3Uy)

In Kaggle the notebook is divided into two parts.
Part 1 uses pre-trained model ProtTrans: [Part1]() 
Part 2 uses pre-trained model ProSE: [Part2]()
